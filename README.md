# Udacity--Natural-Language-Processing-Nano-Degree
This repository contains all the codes related to Udacity's Natural Language Processing Nanodegree

## Installation notes

I used a Ubuntu 16.04 docker image to run this code (with a Nvidia GPU installed on the Ubuntu Docker host)

You should create a Conda Virtual environments using `conda env create -f conda-env.yml` command. Normally the created virtual environment should contain all the required Python libraries to execute the projects. (Don't forget to activate the conda environment with `conda activate nlpnd` before launching Jupyter Lab)
